# ModWork

`ModWork` is an easy and fast way to see your mod locally as you work.
Its biggest pro is that you don't have to restart your game every time you change one of your textures. Just save the texture and alt-tab back into the game for instant updates!

1. Go to `C:\Users\you\Documents\Trackmania\Skins\Stadium\` and create a folder called `ModWork`. In this folder create another folder called `Image`.
2. Any textures you want to mod now go into `Trackmania\Skins\Stadium\ModWork\Image`. Make sure you add the textures you want to edit to `ModWork\Image` before editing them.
3. Open the game and start editing the textures. If you want to add textures to the folder later you'll need to reload the map.

The game checks (only) on map load what files are in `ModWork` and it checks the `.dds` compression if you use `.dds` files.

Note: If you add new image files to the `ModWork` folder or you change the `.dds` compression of an image, you need to reload the map.
