# Watching replays

Spectating and analyzing replays is a great way to learn techniques and racing lines.
Below, you can find a few ways to watch replays from a couple different sources.

### World Record videos

Seasonal campaign world records are being uploaded to YouTube by the community, so you can watch them on the unofficial [Trackmania (2020) WR channel](<https://www.youtube.com/c/Trackmania2020WorldRecords>).

### VIP Keys

To get access to in-game ghosts for streamers and other VIPs, check out [these instructions for VIP keys](</play/vip-keys>). This works for all access levels.

### Leaderboard ghosts

!!! info "Paid access required"

    This feature requires an active **Club Access** subscription.

The **in-game leaderboard widget** (*Settings* -> *Interface* -> *Always display records*) will show you a little üëÅÔ∏è icon next to each record that you can use to load the ghost into your current session.

You can also spectate the ghost by selecting the player's name in the widget.

## PC-exclusive features

Due to platform restrictions, some additional ways to watch replays are only available on the PC version of Trackmania.

### Local replays

!!! info "Paid access required"

    This feature require an active or expired **Standard Access** or **Club Access** subscription.

- You can watch **your own local replays** (as well as other players' replay files) by simply opening the Replay Editor in the Create section - it will let you open any replay stored in `C:\Users\YourUser\Documents\Trackmania\Replays`.

### Leaderboard ghost files

!!! info "Paid access required"

    This feature require an active or expired **Standard Access** or **Club Access** subscription.

To watch **a specific record from the leaderboard** (such as the world record), you can also go to [trackmania.io](<https://trackmania.io>), select the leaderboard and download the ghost file. See [here](<https://openplanet.dev/docs/tutorials/watching-ghosts>) for instructions on how to watch the ghost in-game.
