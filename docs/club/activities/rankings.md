# What are Rankings?

The _Rankings_ activity can be used to display a leaderboard of the club members on specific campaigns or tracks.

## Create a rankings activity

When creating a _Rankings_ activity you will be presented with the following menu:

Here you can choose from the following:

- _Current Quarterly Campaign_ - The official [Seasonal Campaign](/play/what-is-a-seasonal-campaign) provided by Nadeo.
- _Daily Track_ - The current [Track of the Day](/play/what-is-totd).
- _Select a Campaign_ - Any [Campaign](/club/activities/campaign) listed in the club.

After you have made your choice all that is needed now is a name and an optional image, after that the activity can be published.
